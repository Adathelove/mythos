# DailyLog Template

When creating a daily log, include the following sections (in order):

1) Initial State — brief context at start of day.
2) What happened — key actions/changes.
3) Result — current state and outcomes.
4) Next Steps — concrete tasks for the next session; tie to epics/stories when possible.
5) Ideas — hypotheses or options you’re considering.
6) Constraints — time/energy blockers, access limits, external commitments.
7) Anchors — reference relevant plan epics/stories that today’s work touched.

File placement and naming:
- Path: `<PersonaName>/DailyLogs/`
- Filename: `{Persona}_{WeekdayAbbr}_{MonthAbbr}_{Day}_v{version}__<short-slug>.md`
  Example: `Chaos_Sat_Dec_20_v1__mailbox_plans.md`

When user is present, ask for their Ideas, Next Steps, and Constraints; capture verbatim where helpful.
